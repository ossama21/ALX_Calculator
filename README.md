# Project Name
ALX-Calculatore

## About

This project is a C program that calculates the weighted score of a project based on user input. It allows you to define tasks with weights and deadlines and calculates the project's final score using a specified formula. The program differentiates between mandatory and advanced tasks, and it enables you to set different deadlines for each task.

The program uses a structured approach to handle tasks and their associated weights and deadlines, making it easy to organize and calculate the project's weighted score.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- C Compiler (e.g., GCC)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository or download the source code:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ossama21/ALX_Calculator.git

2. Compile the program using a C compiler. For example, with GCC:
        gcc project_weighted_score.c -o project_weighted_score

Usage
Run the compiled program:
./project_weighted_score

Follow the on-screen prompts to input project details:

Specify if the project has advanced tasks.
Enter the number of mandatory tasks.
If applicable, enter the number of advanced tasks.
Input task weights and deadlines as instructed.
The program will calculate and display the project's weighted score.

Advanced Tasks
The program supports different deadlines for tasks. For mandatory tasks, you can set the following deadlines:

1: 100% of the weight
2: 65% of the weight
3: 50% of the weight
For advanced tasks, you can also set these deadlines. Advanced tasks are optional and allow for more fine-grained control over the project's scoring.
